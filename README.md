## Documentation

See the [API reference](http://azuread.github.io/rms-sdk-for-cpp/index.html), created with Doxygen, here. Or, you can create your own build of the API reference by following these steps:

1. Install [Doxygen], for example with `sudo brew install doxygen` (OSX) or `sudo apt-get install doxygen` (Ubuntu).
2. Run `doxygen` from the root of the repo.
3. Open `./docs/html/index.html` in your browser.

Note: Documentation of the API refernce is ongoing.

## Troubleshooting

Information about requests is logged to `rms_log_*`, `rmsauth_log_*`, and `rmscrypto_log_*` in the folder where the executable using these libraries is called from. Request and response headers and some other info is not logged by default to avoid leaking sensitive information. To enable these hidden logs, set an environment variable `RMS_HIDDEN_LOG` to `ON`. For example:

```
> RMS_HIDDEN_LOG=ON ./rms_sample
```
